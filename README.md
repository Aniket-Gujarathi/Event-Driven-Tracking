# Event-driven Tracking with a Particle Filter

The algorithm performs tracking of a circle-shaped target given the event-stream from an event-camera. Two hardware implementations are provided:

## CPU

A C++ YARP module that runs the algorithm on a standard CPU.

- how to compile and run

## SpiNNaker

Python scripts using the "Graph Front End" of the SpiNNaker tool-chain and c-code for running the algorithm on a SpiNNaker board.
